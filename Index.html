            <li>Pack your picnic, your friends and your jukebox and off you go on your river adventure. Let yourself drift and enjoy the sun on the water.</li>

          <hr>
          <p>At a river speed of over 30 m³/s, it is too unsafe for the rubber boat on the water because the water of the Rhine in Rotterdam is flowing very fast: 
            Unfortunately, you'll have to leave your small boat at home, but what about something even bigger? Here are some ideas on how you can still have fun on the water! 
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>Rowing boat: A rowing boat offers more stability and safety than a rubber boat. So don't hesitate to row out onto the river!</li>
            <li>Motorboat: Even without a boating license, you can hire a smaller motorboat and spend an unforgettable day with friends and family on the water.</li>
          </ul> 

          <p>What are you waiting for? Off to the Rhein!</p>
